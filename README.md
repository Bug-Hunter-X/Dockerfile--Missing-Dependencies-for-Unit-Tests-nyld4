This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: failure to install required dependencies. The initial Dockerfile attempts to run unit tests using `unittest`, but fails because the necessary Python packages are missing. The solution adds a `requirements.txt` file specifying dependencies, and installs them in the Dockerfile using `pip`. This ensures that the tests run successfully within the container.
